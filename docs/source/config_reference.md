# Config file reference
## Top level options

### name

  Name of the experiment. It should be a unique name if you want to run a new experiment. If you enable auto resume, the experiment with this name will be resumed instead of starting a new training run.

  Type: str
### scale

  Scale of the model. Most architectures support a scale of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8. A scale of 1 can be used for restoration models that don't change the resolution of the input image. A scale of 2 means the width and height of the input image are doubled, so a 640x480 input will be upscaled to 1280x960.

  Type: int
### num_gpu

  Number of subprocesses to use for data loading with PyTorch dataloader.

  Type: int
### batch_size_per_gpu

  Increasing stabilizes training but going too high can cause issues. Use multiple of 8 for best performance with AMP. A higher batch size, like 32 or 64 is more important when training from scratch, while smaller batches like 8 can be used when training with a quality pretrain model.
